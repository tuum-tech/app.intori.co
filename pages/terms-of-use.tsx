      </p>

      <h2>23) TAX TREATMENT AND ACCOUNTING</h2>
      <p>
        The Company will never provide advice on payments or taxation as it relates to receiving any form of payment in tokens, coins or other form of currency (“Payment”) for developer services, and further, any developer that may receive a Payment from a crypto company or community shall and will assume any and all liabilities and risks related to receiving Payments and taxable income.

Further, the Company is not involved in, or never will be, in the business of promoting investments, ICOs, token offerings, or any type of sale of a cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company does not endorse or rate any cryptocurrencies listed or mentioned on our website, nor do we encourage our developers to invest in any particular cryptocurrency. Holding cryptocurrency is considered a high-risk activity and the Company strongly encourages all developers to perform due diligence before considering developing or receiving a Payment from a particular crypto/blockchain company or community.
      </p>
      <p>
        All transactions received and sent by the Company to developers may be subject to the tax laws and regulations in any applicable jurisdictions.

Tax treatment of cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies may vary amongst jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your participation in developing and receiving crypto payments in connection with any purchase, grant, delivery, exercise, vesting, distribution, activation, holding, use, appreciation, conversion, sale, exchange, redemption, assignment, transfer, disposal, may attract taxes either now or in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company may receive formal or informal queries, notices, requests, or summons from tax authorities, and as a result, the Company may be required to furnish certain information about your Payment from services rendered to a crypto company or community. You must seek independent professional advice on the tax implications in relation to receiving and sending payments, use of the website and/or any other transactions for your particular situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        You alone are responsible for securing your private keys and you expressly release the Company from any and all liability as it relates to the loss of private keys. Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to any credentials, identifiers, coins, or tokens sent to your public address. Neither the Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your coins or tokens if you lose your private keys. Once lost, you will not be able to transfer your credentials, identifiers, coins or tokens to any other address or wallet.
